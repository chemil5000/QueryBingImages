Using many tutorials provided by Microsoft to get it to work...

Use this to query Bing using a csv file with queries in  the first column.
Make sure that the first row already has the querys. No titles.
Make sure that the first column has the query id for each query.
Check the example .csv file [6100_Spanish_contempt.csv] for example formatting.
User must have a Microsoft Azure key to query the marketplace. 

Provide the file path that query results will be stored into. 
Create files as csv before hand.
Results will be provided as urls of the nth (I think I have it set to 15 pages right now) Bing image page for each query in the query file.
